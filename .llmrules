## Source code structure

- `source/`: Source code
  - `service-worker/`: Service worker code
  - `options/`: Options page
    - `components/`: Svelte components
    - `stores/`: Svelte stores
    - `App.svelte`: Main Svelte component
    - `options.scss`: Stylesheet
    - `options.ts`: For initialization of Svelte
- `public/`: Built code
  - `build/`: Built JavaScript and CSS
  - `_locales/`: Localizations
  - `manifest.json`: Manifest
  - `icons/`: Icons

## Build

Build with `npm run build`. Never run the `start:BROWSER` commands, the user will do it manually. Lint with the `npm run lint:types` for TypeScript and `npm run lint:code` for Biome. Do not use `npm run dev` as it will start a long running watch commands - just use `npm run build`.

## Important to note

For every string, add the localization to `public/_locales/LOCALE/messages.json` and use the `getMessage` function to retrieve it. Do not hardcode any strings in the code. Translate the strings in all languages. For German, use the informal (Du) version.

Only add tests for core code and when neccessary. Do not test Svelte components.
